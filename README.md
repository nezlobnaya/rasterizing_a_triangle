# Interactive Rasterized Triangle

## “Rasterization is the task of taking an image described in a vector graphics format ## and converting it into a raster image (a series of pixels, dots, or lines, which, when displayed together, create the image which was represented via shapes).” — Wikipedia

## What you will learn by building this:

###    Loops, loops, loops! — You’ll need to recalculate a lot of graphics when the user drags the triangle corners.

###    HTML, CSS, JavaScript — Notice how the triangle is composed of individual tiny squares.

###    Working event listeners — Whenever the user drags around the triangle, it changes width and height.
